## Currently in process
Remaking my old Qt/C++ app on Flutter.

- Check out the Rust server: https://github.com/adsick/qhub
- Trying to keep the Trello board up to date (but no guarantee): https://trello.com/b/LrTZFV3o/qhub

## Current state:
- Log in and sign up pages (implemented server requests)
- Feed page backend logic (dummies for now though)
- Working on the feed page UI
- That's it
